# Linkerhub Widget

## What is the purpose

Simple browser extension, which only goal (for now) is to display the information
about the open tab page.

Information is taken from our API, and almost 1 to 1 copies the information and interface of the main website.

It tells you all the info that we have in our DB about the page: title, description, rating, category, tags, etc.

## How to use

At any page you want to get the info from, open the widget.
If the page is present in our DB, we will provide you all the info, including title, description, rating, category, tags, etc.
If the page does not exist in our DB, you will be prompted to add it.
